[ss,.05]Hello,[w, .15] welcome to Wormmart.[w, 2]

[c] I'm sorry it took so long to start checking you out,[w,.3] the mother of 16 in front of you paid entirely in coupon codes. [w, 5.75] [w,.75][c] 

[c] At least these kids were nice though.[w, 2]

[c] The last time there were that many in here, a kindergarten field trip stopped by for snacks but they went wild and all heck broke loose! [w,2]

[c] A couple of them made a mech outta the Legos.[w, .2] They blew up the candy aisle![w,2]

[c] Then they drew on the walls with so many different colored crayons that a part of the store was just a black void and I had to wash it all myself![w,3]

[c] The worst part is my manager didn't even pay me for the 37 hours of overtime.[w,2]

[c] She just threw me a pizza party.[w,.15] It wasn't even good pizza, it was Little Caesars![w, 2]

[c] They were just being kids though,[w,.15] so I forgive them.[w,2]

[c] But,[w,.2] I can never forgive Ms. Karen Snitcherson.[w,2]

[c] The first time she was here when her card was declined and she blamed us for having faulty equipment,[w,.15] she went so far as to charge us with tax evasion![w,2]

[c] The time after she claimed that we sold her spoiled milk, and after I showed her that the milk had a full week left on it, she came back from the future to swap it out with the same jug from a week later![w,2]

[c] But that was nowhere near as irritating as when she claimed I was[w, .35] "verbally attacking her"[w,.35] when I asked if she wanted a tote or paper bag.[w,2]

[c] She ended up calling the National Guard on us,[w,.15] and when my manager came to help she got kidnapped by Special Forces.[w,3]

[c] We haven't heard from her since.[w,2] 

[c] Don't even get me started about my co-workers![w,.3] There are only like 4 of us despite it being a full-sized Walmart.[w,2]

[c] Karey's the janitor,[w,.15] Maya is our manager,[w,.15] Devin does delivery and brings in the shipments,[w,.15] and I d[ss, .15]o...[ss,.05]everything else.[w,2]

[c] It's been 8 days since I last saw a bed and I've been on shift for the last 40 hours.[w,2]

[c] I've had to drink so much coffee my blood is 60% caffeine.[w,2]

[c] Ah, sorry for taking so long to scan your stuff![w,.15] My elbow is locking up,[w,.15] it usually does after the 10th hour of scanning. [w,2]

[c] I was looking into getting a chiropractor for it,[w,.15] not that I can afford one anyway. [w,2] 

[c] This job only pays me 7 cents an hour. [w, 2] [exit]
